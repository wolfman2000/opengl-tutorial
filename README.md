# opengl-tutorial

The goal of this project is to go through the [open.gl](https://open.gl/) tutorial series using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/). Assuming this is done correctly, there will be plenty of branches, tags, and failures.

Anyone that chooses to follow along: hopefully you learn a thing or two.
